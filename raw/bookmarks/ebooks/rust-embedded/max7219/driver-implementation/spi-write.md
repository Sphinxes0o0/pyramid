# [SPI Communication](#spi-communication){.header}

We will write two internal helper functions to handle SPI communication with the MAX7219 devices in the chain(or just single device).

## [Writing to a Single Device Register in the Chain](#writing-to-a-single-device-register-in-the-chain){.header}

The first function, `write_device_register`, sends a single register update to one device in the chain. We start by clearing the entire buffer and then fill only the 2-byte packet (register address and data) for the target device at the correct position in the buffer. Finally, we send the buffer up to the length needed for the connected devices.

If there is just a single device (device index 0, which is the closest to the microcontroller), the offset for the register address is 0 \* 2 = 0, and the data byte goes to index 1.

When there are multiple devices, we write at the right offset for the target device, and the rest of the buffer remains zeros (no-ops) to avoid affecting other devices.

For example, if there are 4 devices and we want to write to the device at index 2 (the third device from the left), the offset for the register address is 2 \* 2 = 4, and the data byte goes at index 5.

So the full data sent through SPI will look like this (2 bytes per device):

::: table-wrapper
  Index   0   1   2   3   4               5      6   7
  ------- --- --- --- --- --------------- ------ --- ---
  Value   0   0   0   0   register_addr   data   0   0
:::

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    pub(crate) fn write_device_register(
        &mut self,
        device_index: usize,
        register: Register,
        data: u8,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        if device_index >= self.device_count {
            return Err(Error::InvalidDeviceIndex);
        }

        self.buffer = [0; MAX_DISPLAYS * 2];

        let offset = device_index * 2; // 2 bytes(16 bits packet) per display
        self.buffer[offset] = register as u8;
        self.buffer[offset + 1] = data;

        self.spi.write(&self.buffer[0..self.device_count * 2])?;

        Ok(())
    }
    }

## [Writing to All Device Registers at Once](#writing-to-all-device-registers-at-once){.header}

We will create a second function called `write_all_registers` that allows us to send register updates to every device in the daisy chain in a single SPI transaction. This approach is more efficient for operations such as powering on all devices, adjusting brightness, or applying other settings to all displays at once.

:::

It takes a slice of (Register, u8) tuples, where each tuple contains the register and data for each device in the chain.

We start by clearing the buffer. Then we start filling packets for each devices. The packet we write in the first index of the array goes to leftmost device.

> In a daisy chain, the MAX7219 shifts data starting from the rightmost device, which is closest to the microcontroller, toward the leftmost device. So when SPI sends data starting at index 0 in the buffer, that packet actually ends up at the leftmost device.

For example, if we have 4 devices and want to send register-data pairs to all, the buffer fills like this:

::: table-wrapper
  Index     0       1        2       3        4       5        6       7
  --------- ------- -------- ------- -------- ------- -------- ------- --------
  Content   reg_0   data_0   reg_1   data_1   reg_2   data_2   reg_3   data_3
:::

Here, bytes 0 and 1 are for device 0, bytes 2 and 3 for device 1, and so on.

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    pub(crate) fn write_all_registers(&mut self, ops: &[(Register, u8)]) -> Result<()> {
        // clear the buffer: 2 bytes per device
        self.buffer = [0; MAX_DISPLAYS * 2];

        // fill in reverse order so that SPI shifts into the last device first
        for (i, &(reg, data)) in ops.iter().enumerate() {
            let offset = i * 2;
            self.buffer[offset] = reg as u8;
            self.buffer[offset + 1] = data;
        }

        // send exactly device_count packets
        let len = self.device_count * 2;
        self.spi.write(&self.buffer[..len])?;

        Ok(())
    }
    }

If you are curious and want to understand it better, you can remove the pub(crate) marker from these functions to make them accessible outside the crate. Then, create an instance of the Max7219 struct and call these functions with raw register values. For example, try sending `0x01` to the Shutdown register and watch how the display reacts. (At least that\'s what I did when I was building the driver and testing the initial setup.)

## [Tests](#tests){.header}

We add tests to verify the SPI communication functions. One test checks that writing to a device index outside the allowed range returns an error. Another test confirms that writing to a valid device index sends the correct SPI data for that device while sending no-ops to others. The third test verifies that write_all_registers sends the correct data for all devices in the chain in one SPI transaction.

As you might already know (we explained this in the DHT22 driver chapter), when using the embedded-hal mock, we need to set expectations; in this case, for the SPI mock. Each SPI transaction must be marked clearly using the transaction_start and transaction_end functions.

If you look at the `test_write_all_registers_valid` function, you\'ll see that all the SPI data is wrapped inside a single transaction. This is because the `write_all_registers` function uses just one SPI transaction to send commands to all devices at once.
