# [Error Handling](#error-handling){.header}

The DHT22 sensor communication is time-sensitive and error-prone. To deal with possible failures, we define a custom DhtError enum that describes what can go wrong during a sensor read.

Let\'s create the error module. Add the following line in lib.rs:

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    pub mod error;

    // re-export the DhtError for library users
    pub use error::DhtError;
    }

## [Contents of error.rs file](#contents-of-errorrs-file){.header} {#contents-of-errorrs-file}

Create an error.rs file inside the src folder and add the following code:

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    /// Possible errors from the DHT22 driver.
    #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
    pub enum DhtError<E> {
        /// Timed out waiting for a pin state change.
        Timeout,
        /// Checksum did not match the received data.
        ChecksumMismatch,
        /// Error from the GPIO pin (input/output).
        PinError(E),
    }

    impl<E> From<E> for DhtError<E> {
        fn from(value: E) -> Self {
            Self::PinError(value)
        }
    }
    }

The DhtError enum represents three different kinds of errors that can occur during sensor communication.

- **Timeout:** If the sensor does not respond within the expected time during any stage of communication, we return DhtError::Timeout. This can happen, for example, when we wait for the sensor to pull the data line low or high but it never happens.

- **ChecksumMismatch:** After receiving the 5 bytes of data, we calculate the checksum from the first 4 bytes and compare it with the checksum byte sent by the sensor. If they do not match, we return DhtError::ChecksumMismatch. This typically means that some bits were corrupted during transmission.

- **PinError:** Sometimes, GPIO operations themselves can fail. For example, setting a pin high or low, or reading its level, may return an error depending on the HAL used. We wrap such errors using DhtError::PinError so that they can be reported along with the rest.

We also implement From for DhtError. This allows any pin-level error to be automatically converted into our error type. It enables us to use the ? operator when calling GPIO methods inside the driver, without having to convert the error manually every time.
