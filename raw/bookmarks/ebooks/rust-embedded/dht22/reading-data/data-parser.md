# [Data Parser](#data-parser){.header}

The parse_data function takes the raw data bytes from the sensor and converts them into meaningful temperature and humidity values. The DHT22 sends two bytes for humidity and two for temperature.

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    fn parse_data(&self, data: [u8; 4]) -> Reading {
        let [hum_hi, hum_lo, temp_hi, temp_lo] = data;

        let joined_humidity = u16::from_be_bytes([hum_hi, hum_lo]);
        let relative_humidity = joined_humidity as f32 / 10.0;

        let is_temp_negative = (temp_hi >> 7) != 0;
        let temp_hi = temp_hi & 0b0111_1111;
        let joined_temp = u16::from_be_bytes([temp_hi, temp_lo]);
        let mut temperature = joined_temp as f32 / 10.0;
        if is_temp_negative {
            temperature = -temperature;
        }

        Reading {
            temperature,
            relative_humidity,
        }
    }
    }

## [Decode Humidity](#decode-humidity){.header}

The humidity is received as two bytes: hum_hi and hum_lo. These two bytes together form a 16-bit number. We join them using:

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let joined_humidity = u16::from_be_bytes([hum_hi, hum_lo]);
    }

The actual humidity is this value divided by 10.0:

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let relative_humidity = joined_humidity as f32 / 10.0;
    }

For example, if the sensor sends 0x02 and 0x58 (which is 600 in decimal), the humidity will be 600 / 10 = 60.0%.

## [Decode Temperature](#decode-temperature){.header}

The temperature is also received as two bytes: temp_hi and temp_lo.

However, the sensor uses the highest bit of \"temp_hi\" to indicate if the temperature is negative. So first, we check if that bit is set:

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let is_temp_negative = (temp_hi >> 7) != 0;
    }

We then clear the sign bit (bit 7) before combining the bytes:

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let temp_hi = temp_hi & 0b0111_1111;
    let joined_temp = u16::from_be_bytes([temp_hi, temp_lo]);
    let mut temperature = joined_temp as f32 / 10.0;
    }

If the temperature was marked as negative, we flip the sign:

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
     if is_temp_negative {
        temperature = -temperature;
    }
    }

Finally, we return the result:

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
     Reading {
        temperature,
        relative_humidity,
    }
    }

## [Testing parser](#testing-parser){.header}

There is nothing complex going on in these tests. We are simply checking if the parse_data function correctly converts raw bytes into meaningful temperature and humidity values.

In the first test, we pass a sample input representing 55.5% humidity and 24.6°C temperature and assert that the output matches.

In the second test, we use a special case where the temperature is negative (-1.0°C). The most significant bit (bit 7) in the temperature high byte is set, which signals a negative temperature.

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    #[test]
    fn test_parse_data_positive_temp() {
        let mut pin = PinMock::new(&[]);

        let dht = Dht22::new(pin.clone(), NoopDelay);
        // Humidity: 55.5% -> [0x02, 0x2B] => 555
        // Temperature: 24.6C -> [0x00, 0xF6] => 246
        let data = [0x02, 0x2B, 0x00, 0xF6];

        let reading = dht.parse_data(data);

        assert_eq!(
            reading,
            Reading {
                relative_humidity: 55.5,
                temperature: 24.6,
            }
        );
        pin.done();
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_parse_data_negative_temp() {
        let mut pin = PinMock::new(&[]);

        let dht = Dht22::new(pin.clone(), NoopDelay);

        // Humidity: 40.0% -> [0x01, 0x90] => 400
        // Temperature: -1.0C -> [0x80, 0x0A]
        // Bit 7 of temp_hi is 1 => negative
        // Clear sign bit: 0x80 & 0x7F = 0x00, so [0x00, 0x0A] = 10 => 1.0 then negated
        let data = [0x01, 0x90, 0x80, 0x0A];

        let reading = dht.parse_data(data);

        assert_eq!(
            reading,
            Reading {
                relative_humidity: 40.0,
                temperature: -1.0,
            }
        );
        pin.done();
    }
    }
