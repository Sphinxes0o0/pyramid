# [Demo App](#demo-app){.header}

Now we have the RTC HAL crate and two drivers (DS1307 and DS3231) that implement the traits provided by the RTC HAL. Next, we will make a demo app to show how this works. I will make a project for the ESP32 chip.

In this project, we will have two feature flags: \"ds1307\" (turned on by default) and \"ds3231\" for the demo project. I will not explain all the details about making this project (you should already know how to do this) or how to set up these feature flags. I will only talk about the important parts. I recommend you look at this repository for the complete project: \"<https://github.com/implferris/rtc-hal-demo>\"

## [Cargo.toml file](#cargotoml-file){.header} {#cargotoml-file}

### [Feature flag](#feature-flag){.header}

The feature flags define which RTC driver to include in the build. We set DS1307 as the default.

``` toml
[features]
default = ["ds1307"]        # DS1307 is the default
ds3231 = ["dep:ds3231-rtc"]
ds1307 = ["dep:ds1307-rtc"]
```

### [Additional Dependency](#additional-dependency){.header}

We mark RTC driver dependency as optional and will only be included when their corresponding feature is enabled.

> Here: replace rtc-hal, ds3231-rtc, and ds1307-rtc with your GitHub url or local folder path.

``` toml
# ...
embedded-hal-bus = "0.3.0"

# rtc-hal = { version = "0.3.0", features = ["defmt"] }
# ds3231-rtc = { version = "0.2.2", optional = true }
# ds1307-rtc = { version = "0.2.2", optional = true }

rtc-hal = { git = "https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/rtc-hal", features = ["defmt"] }
ds3231-rtc = { git = "https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/ds3231-rtc", optional = true }
ds1307-rtc = { git = "https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/ds1307-rtc", optional = true }
```

## [App module (app.rs)](#app-module-apprs){.header} {#app-module-apprs}

This is the main app code that works with any RTC driver.

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    use esp_alloc as _;
    use rtc_hal::error::{Error, ErrorKind};
    use rtc_hal::square_wave::{SquareWave, SquareWaveFreq};
    use rtc_hal::{datetime::DateTime, rtc::Rtc};

    type Result<T> = core::result::Result<T, ErrorKind>;

    pub struct DemoApp<RTC> {
        rtc: RTC,
    }

    impl<RTC> DemoApp<RTC>
    where
        RTC: Rtc,
    {
        pub fn new(rtc: RTC) -> Self {
            Self { rtc }
        }

        pub fn set_datetime(&mut self, dt: &DateTime) -> Result<()> {
            self.rtc.set_datetime(dt).map_err(|e| e.kind())?;
            Ok(())
        }

        pub fn print_current_time(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
            let current_time = self.rtc.get_datetime().map_err(|e| e.kind())?;

            defmt::info!(
                "📅 {}-{:02}-{:02} 🕐 {:02}:{:02}:{:02}",
                current_time.year(),
                current_time.month(),
                current_time.day_of_month(),
                current_time.hour(),
                current_time.minute(),
                current_time.second()
            );
            Ok(())
        }
    }

    impl<RTC> DemoApp<RTC>
    where
        RTC: SquareWave,
    {
        pub fn start_square_wave(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
            self.rtc
                .start_square_wave(SquareWaveFreq::Hz1)
                .map_err(|e| e.kind())?;
            Ok(())
        }

        pub fn stop_square_wave(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
            self.rtc.disable_square_wave().map_err(|e| e.kind())?;
            Ok(())
        }
    }
    }

Let\'s break it down.

### [Main struct](#main-struct){.header}

The app uses generics () so it can work with any RTC chip that implements our RTC HAL traits. This means the same code works for both DS1307 and DS3231.

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    pub struct DemoApp<RTC> {
        rtc: RTC,
    }
    }

### [Basic RTC Functions:](#basic-rtc-functions){.header}

The first impl block needs the RTC type to have the Rtc trait. It lets you set and get current datetime in a nice format.

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    impl<RTC> DemoApp<RTC>
    where
        RTC: Rtc,
    {
    ...
    }
    }

### [Square Wave Functions:](#square-wave-functions){.header}

The second impl block needs the RTC type to have the SquareWave trait. In the demo, we let users start or stop the square wave output.

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    impl<RTC> DemoApp<RTC>
    where
        RTC: SquareWave,
    {
    ...
    }
    }

## [Main module (main.rs)](#main-module-mainrs){.header} {#main-module-mainrs}

In the main module, we first set up the i2c bus. I have connected the SCL pin of RTC to GPIO pin 22 of ESP32 Devkit v1 and SDA pin of RTC to GPIO pin 21 of ESP32 Devkit v1.

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let i2c_bus = esp_hal::i2c::master::I2c::new(
            peripherals.I2C0,
            esp_hal::i2c::master::Config::default().with_frequency(Rate::from_khz(100)),
        )
        .unwrap()
        .with_scl(peripherals.GPIO22)
        .with_sda(peripherals.GPIO21);
    }

Note: We use 100 kHz speed which works well with both RTC chips.

### [Create the Initial Date and Time](#create-the-initial-date-and-time){.header}

We create a datetime object that we\'ll use to set the initial time on the RTC chip. This is like setting a clock when you first get it.

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let dt = DateTime::new(2025, 9, 2, 23, 41, 30).unwrap();
    }

Note: This creates a datetime object for September 2, 2025 at 23:41:30 (11:41:30 PM). You can change these values to match the current date and time when you run the program.

### [Choose Which RTC Driver to Use](#choose-which-rtc-driver-to-use){.header}

Here\'s where our feature flags come into play. We let the compiler pick which RTC driver to use based on what features are turned on.

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    #[cfg(feature = "ds3231")]
    let rtc = ds3231_rtc::Ds3231::new(i2c_bus);

    #[cfg(not(feature = "ds3231"))]
    let rtc = ds1307_rtc::Ds1307::new(i2c_bus);
    }

## [Create Our Demo App](#create-our-demo-app){.header}

We create our demo app with whichever RTC driver was picked above. This shows the real power of our RTC HAL design.

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let mut app = DemoApp::new(rtc);
    }

The same app code works with different chips without any changes. Our app doesn\'t need to know if it\'s talking to a DS1307 or DS3231 - it just uses the common traits we defined.

## [Run the RTC Demo](#run-the-rtc-demo){.header}

Finally, we run through a complete demo that shows all the RTC features working together.

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    info!("setting datetime");
    app.set_datetime(&dt).unwrap();

    info!("starting square wave");
    app.start_square_wave().unwrap();

    let delay_start = Instant::now();
    while delay_start.elapsed() < Duration::from_secs(60) {}
    info!("stopping square wave");
    app.stop_square_wave().unwrap();

    loop {
        info!("----------");
        info!("getting datetime");
        info!("----------");
        if let Err(e) = app.print_current_time() {
            info!("RTC Error: {}", e);
        }
        let delay_start = Instant::now();
        while delay_start.elapsed() < Duration::from_minutes(1) {}
    }
    }
