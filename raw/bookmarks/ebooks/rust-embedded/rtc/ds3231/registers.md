# [DS3231 Registers](#ds3231-registers){.header}

The datetime registers in the DS3231 are almost the same as those in the DS1307. Both chips store time and date information in a series of registers that you can read or write through I2C.

However, there are a few differences:

- **Oscillator Control**: The DS1307 has a Clock Halt (CH) bit in the Seconds register, while the DS3231 has an Enable Oscillator (EOSC) bit in the Control register. However, they behave differently; the DS3231\'s EOSC bit only affects operation when the RTC is running on battery power.

- **Century bit:** Month Register (0x05) includes a century bit (bit 7) for year overflow tracking. The DS3231 can store years from 00 to 99 in its year register (like 24 for 2024). When the year rolls over from 99 back to 00 (like going from 2099 to 2100), the century bit automatically flips from 0 to 1. This tells your program that you\'ve moved into the next century. Your code can check this bit to know whether year \"24\" means 2024 or 2124. This allows the DS3231 to track dates from 2000 to 2199, giving it 200 years of date range compared to the DS1307\'s 100 years (2000-2099).

- \*\*No NVRAM: The DS3231 does not have the built-in NVRAM that the DS1307 offers.

- Extra features: The DS3231 includes additional registers for features the DS1307 doesn\'t have, such as two alarm registers, temperature registers, and control and status registers for managing the square wave output and alarm events.

## [Register Map](#register-map){.header}

Here is the simplified register map tables.

### [DateTime Registers (0x00-0x06)](#datetime-registers-0x00-0x06){.header}

These registers store the current date and time information. They work almost the same as DS1307 registers, using BCD format for most values.

::: table-wrapper
  Address   Register        Range            Notes
  --------- --------------- ---------------- -------------------------
  0x00      Seconds         00-59            Bit 7 unused (always 0)
  0x01      Minutes         00-59            \-
  0x02      Hours           01-12 or 00-23   Bit 6: 12/24 hour mode
  0x03      Day of Week     1-7              User defined
  0x04      Date            01-31            \-
  0x05      Month/Century   01-12            Bit 7: Century bit
  0x06      Year            00-99            \-

As you can see, we should be able to reuse the datetime parsing logic from DS1307 driver code with slight modifications.

### [Control and Status Registers](#control-and-status-registers){.header}

These registers manage the DS3231\'s special features and show its current status.

::: table-wrapper
  Address     Register       Purpose
  ----------- -------------- ------------------------------------
  0x0E        Control        Alarm enables, square wave control
  0x0F        Status         Alarm flags, oscillator status
  0x10        Aging Offset   Crystal aging compensation
  0x11-0x12   Temperature    Internal temperature sensor data

### [Alarm Registers](#alarm-registers){.header}

The DS3231 includes two programmable alarms:

- **Alarm 1 (0x07-0x0A)**: Seconds, minutes, hours, day/date precision
- **Alarm 2 (0x0B-0x0D)**: Minutes, hours, day/date precision (no seconds)
