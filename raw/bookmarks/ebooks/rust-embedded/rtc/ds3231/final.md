# [Final](#final){.header}

Finally, we have successfully implemented the rtc-hal traits for the DS3231 driver. We will now update lib.rs to re-export the core traits and main struct, providing a clean and convenient public API for users of our driver.

    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    pub mod control;
    pub mod datetime;
    mod ds3231;
    pub mod error;
    pub mod registers;
    pub mod square_wave;

    // Re-export Ds3231
    pub use ds3231::Ds3231;

    // Re-export RTC HAL
    pub use rtc_hal::{datetime::DateTime, rtc::Rtc};
    }

You have now completed the RTC chapter! You built both the DS1307 and DS3231 drivers. Next, i will show you a demo of how to use them.
