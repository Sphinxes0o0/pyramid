# [Non-volatile memory](#non-volatile-memory){.header}

Some RTCs include built-in non-volatile memory (NVRAM) for storing user data that persists even when the main power is lost. For example, the DS1307 has 56 bytes of NVRAM, while the DS3231 has none. This memory is separate from the timekeeping registers and can store configuration settings, calibration data, or any application-specific information.

The `RtcNvram` trait provides a simple interface for reading and writing this memory. It uses byte-level addressing with an offset parameter, allowing you to access any portion of the available NVRAM. The trait also includes a nvram_size() method so applications can determine how much memory is available.
